# Bill App by Alex Florisca

To run,
    npm install && bower install && grunt

To run tests, npm test or npm run test

Notes:

- I focused more on the javascript and testing part of the app rather than styling. I could have made it look awesome too given more time.
- UX wise, I focused on minimal, mobile first and readable. Haven't added any breakpoint on purpose as they're not needed here, but I would have used breakpoint-sass to do this.
- The ajax module is my own, and use in various projects
- I haven't handled every edge case (e.g. When endpoint doesn't return JSON), but I am aware of them
